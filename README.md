This is a Python script I wrote years ago which uses the lambda function.

You have the option of creating an account or making a new one which gets saved in a text file.

After that it proceeds to allow the user to select the subject of their choice, the difficulty and the quiz will be generated. 

At the end, the score will be output and saved in a text file.

If you want to try this script, download the text files, and if you want to play around with the questions, you can change them on the quizzes.txt file.
